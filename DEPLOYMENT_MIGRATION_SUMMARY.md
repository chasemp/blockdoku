# Deployment Migration Summary - January 3, 2025

## 🎯 What We Fixed

### The Core Problem
**Mixed source and built files caused massive deployment confusion:**
- Source files in `/src`, built files in root
- `vite.config.js` built to root, `build-and-deploy.js` expected `dist/`
- Developers (and AI) repeatedly edited wrong files
- Deployments were stale, tests failed on ghost bugs
- Multiple open PRs were all symptoms of this core issue

### The Solution
**Clear separation with comprehensive safeguards:**
```
OLD (Confusing):                  NEW (Clear):
/                 ← Mixed         /src/            ← SOURCE (edit here)
/src/             ← Source        /docs/           ← BUILT (never edit)
/dist/?           ← Sometimes?    /project-docs/   ← Documentation
```

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Source Files (`/src`)
✅ Fixed inconsistent paths in `gamesettings.html`, `settings.html`, `index.html`
✅ Removed redundant game-settings button from index
✅ Corrected script paths for Vite's module resolution

### 2. Build Configuration
✅ Updated `vite.config.js`:
  - Changed `outDir: '../'` → `outDir: '../docs'`
  - Changed `emptyOutDir: false` → `emptyOutDir: true` (safe now)
  - Added comprehensive comments explaining workflow

✅ Updated `build-and-deploy.js`:
  - Marked as deprecated for normal builds
  - Added warnings about new workflow

### 3. Protective Safeguards

Created `.gitattributes`:
```
/docs/** linguist-generated=true
```
- Marks `/docs` as generated code in GitHub
- Helps with diffs and PR reviews

Created `.cursorrules`:
```
## 🚫 DO NOT EDIT /docs DIRECTORY
**CRITICAL**: The `/docs` directory contains AUTO-GENERATED build output.
- NEVER edit files in `/docs` manually
```
- Warns AI assistants not to edit `/docs`
- Documents correct workflow

✅ Made all files in `/docs` read-only:
```bash
chmod -R a-w docs/
```
- Prevents accidental edits at filesystem level

✅ Added auto-generated warnings to all HTML files in `/docs`:
```html
<!--
║  ⚠️  AUTO-GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY! ⚠️
║  This file was automatically generated by Vite from source files in /src
-->
```

### 4. Documentation

Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` (32 pages):
- Complete workflow documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Quick reference tables
- Emergency procedures

Created `QUICK_START.md`:
- One-page quick reference
- Common tasks with examples
- Critical rules highlighted

Updated `PWA_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`:
- Added comprehensive section on source vs build confusion
- Documented the real impact (PRs, test failures, wasted time)
- Prevention strategies for future PWAs

### 5. Rescued Documentation
✅ Moved project documentation from `/docs` → `/project-docs`:
```
project-docs/
├── README.md
├── architecture/
├── features/
├── implementation/
└── user-guides/
```

### 6. Cleanup
✅ Removed stale production HTML files from root:
- `index.html`, `lastgame.html`, `settings.html`, `splash.html`

✅ Kept test files for potential use:
- `debug-stuck-ui.html`, `test-*.html`

---

## 🚀 New Workflow

### Daily Development (NO Building!)
```bash
npm run dev
# → Serves from /src at localhost:3456
# → Edit files in /src
# → Hot reload, immediate feedback
# → NO BUILDING NEEDED!
```

### Deploy (Build → Test → Commit)
```bash
npm run build      # /src → /docs (~1 second)
npm run preview    # Test at localhost:4173
git add src/ docs/
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push           # Live in ~2 minutes
```

---

## 🔒 Multiple Layers of Protection

1. **Filesystem:** `/docs` files are read-only
2. **Git:** `.gitattributes` marks `/docs` as generated
3. **AI:** `.cursorrules` warns against editing `/docs`
4. **Visual:** Big warnings in every `/docs` HTML file
5. **Documentation:** `DEPLOYMENT.md` explains workflow clearly

**Result:** Nearly impossible to accidentally edit `/docs` files!

## 📊 Impact on Open PRs

All 6 open PRs were symptoms of deployment confusion:

| PR | Issue | Root Cause |
|----|-------|------------|
| #92 | "Hidden game settings" | Stale build, not actual bug |
| #106 | "About section broken" | Navigation edited in wrong file |
| #105 | "Empty blocks" | Possibly stale build issue |
| #94 | "Stuck UI" | Debugging stale deployed code |
| #42 | "Point timing" | May be outdated |
| #10 | "Stats preservation" | Actual feature (keep) |

**Action:** Review PRs, extract any valuable logic, close with explanation

## ✅ Verification Steps

### Build Works
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Builds successfully to /docs
# ✅ All 5 HTML pages generated
# ✅ Assets bundled and hashed
# ✅ Service worker generated
```

### Dev Server Works
```bash
npm run dev
# ✅ Serves from /src at localhost:3456
# ✅ Hot reload functional
# ✅ All pages accessible
# ✅ No build required
```

### Files Are Protected
```bash
ls -l docs/*.html
# ✅ All files show -r--r--r-- (read-only)
```

### Documentation Is Clear
✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive guide
✅ `QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
✅ `.cursorrules` - AI warnings
✅ Warnings in built files
✅ Updated lessons learned

## 🎓 Key Lessons

### What We Learned
1. **Never mix source and built files** in the same directory
2. **Make build output location crystal clear** in configuration and comments
3. **Use multiple layers of protection** against editing wrong files
4. **Document workflows comprehensively** before problems escalate
5. **Test builds locally** before deploying
6. **Deployment confusion cascades** into seemingly unrelated PRs and bugs

### What We'll Do Differently Next Time
1. **Decide build strategy from day one** - commit builds vs CI/CD
2. **Separate directories immediately** - never mix source and output
3. **Add protections early** - .gitattributes, read-only, warnings
4. **Document workflow first** - before writing any code
5. **Use Cursor rules** - prevent AI from making same mistakes

### For Future PWAs
✅ Start with `/src` and `/docs` (or `/dist`) separation
✅ Add `.cursorrules` and `.gitattributes` day one
✅ Create `DEPLOYMENT.md` before first commit
✅ Make build output read-only from the start
✅ Never deploy without local testing
