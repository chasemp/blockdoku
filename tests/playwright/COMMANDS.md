# Blockdoku PWA - MCP Playwright Test Commands

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### Automated Test Execution (No Manual Intervention Required)

```bash
# Run automated MCP Playwright tests (simulated execution)
npm run test:e2e:execute

# Run automated test with detailed output
npm run test:e2e:auto

# Generate MCP Playwright commands for direct execution
npm run test:e2e:direct
```

### Manual Test Execution (Requires MCP Playwright)

```bash
# View test instructions (original)
npm run test:e2e

# View detailed instructions
npm run test:e2e:instructions

# Generate MCP Playwright commands
npm run test:mcp:commands

# Generate complete test file
npm run test:mcp:generate
```

## ðŸš€ Recommended Workflow

### Option 1: Fully Automated (No MCP Playwright Required)
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run automated tests
npm run test:e2e:execute
```

### Option 2: MCP Playwright Direct Execution
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Generate MCP Playwright commands
npm run test:e2e:direct

# Copy and paste the generated commands into MCP Playwright
# No further instructions needed - just execute the commands
```

### Option 3: Manual Testing with Instructions
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# View detailed instructions
npm run test:e2e:instructions

# Follow the step-by-step guide with MCP Playwright
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Use Cases

### For Quick Testing
- Use `npm run test:e2e:execute` for fast, automated testing
- No MCP Playwright setup required
- Good for CI/CD or quick validation

### For MCP Playwright Integration
- Use `npm run test:e2e:direct` for ready-to-use commands
- Copy and paste commands directly into MCP Playwright
- No manual instruction following required

### For Learning/Debugging
- Use `npm run test:e2e:instructions` for detailed step-by-step guide
- Good for understanding what the tests do
- Helpful for debugging specific issues

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Adding New Tests
1. Edit `tests/playwright/auto-execute-mcp.js`
2. Add new commands to the `getMCPCommands()` method
3. Update test sequence as needed

### Modifying Commands
1. Edit `tests/playwright/run-mcp-direct.js`
2. Update element references and selectors
3. Add or remove test steps

### Changing Test Parameters
1. Edit `tests/playwright/run-mcp-automated.js`
2. Modify timing delays and success criteria
3. Update error handling logic

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

All test commands should achieve:
- âœ… **100% Navigation Success**: All links work correctly
- âœ… **100% Theme Consistency**: Themes sync across pages
- âœ… **0 Console Errors**: No JavaScript errors during testing
- âœ… **< 2s Load Times**: All pages load quickly
- âœ… **100% State Preservation**: Game state maintained during navigation

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Server not running**: Ensure `npm run dev` is started first
- **Element not found**: Update element references if UI changes
- **Timing issues**: Adjust delays in test execution scripts

### Debug Mode
- Add `console.log` statements to track execution
- Use browser developer tools to inspect elements
- Check MCP Playwright logs for detailed error information
