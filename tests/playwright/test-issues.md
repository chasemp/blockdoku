2. **Fix navigation buttons** - Basic navigation not working
3. **Fix block placement** - Gameplay mechanics broken

### Medium Priority
4. **Fix theme synchronization** - User experience issue
5. **Fix settings page sections** - Settings functionality limited

### Low Priority
6. **Clean up console warnings** - Code quality improvement

## 游냍 Error Patterns

### Common Timeout Errors

## 游닇 Test Execution Notes

### When Running Tests
1. **Always check console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Note timeout errors** - they indicate broken functionality
3. **Verify actual behavior** vs expected behavior
4. **Document new issues** as they're discovered
5. **Update this file** with new findings

### Test Reliability
- **Current reliability**: ~19% (4/21 tests passing)
- **Main blockers**: Difficulty switching, navigation, block placement
- **Recommendation**: Fix critical issues before running comprehensive tests

## 游댃 Issue Resolution Process

1. **Identify issue** during test execution
2. **Categorize severity** (Critical/Moderate/Minor)
3. **Document in this file** with details
4. **Fix the underlying code** issue
5. **Re-run affected tests** to verify fix
6. **Update status** in this file
7. **Remove resolved issues** when confirmed fixed

## 游늳 Success Metrics

- **Target**: 95% test pass rate (20/21 tests)
- **Current**: 19% test pass rate (4/21 tests)
- **Critical fixes needed**: 3 major functionality issues
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours of debugging and fixes
