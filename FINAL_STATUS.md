# Deployment Migration - Final Status

## âœ… Complete!

### What Was Fixed
1. **Deployment Model:** `/src` â†’ `/docs` with clear separation
2. **Extracted PR Fixes:**
   - âœ… PR #105: Empty blocks on load (fully applied)
   - âœ… PR #94: Stuck UI timeout (already mostly implemented, order fixed)
3. **Protections Added:**
   - Read-only `/docs` files
   - `.gitattributes` marks `/docs` as generated
   - `.cursorrules` warns against editing `/docs`
   - Auto-generated warnings in all HTML files
4. **Documentation Created:**
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` (comprehensive)
   - `QUICK_START.md` (one-page reference)
   - `DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (what changed)
   - `PWA_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (updated)
   - `PR_CLOSURE_PLAN.md` (how to close PRs)
   - `EXTRACTED_FROM_PRS.md` (what code we extracted)
