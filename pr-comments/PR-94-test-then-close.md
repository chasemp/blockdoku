# PR #94: Debug stuck game ui state - TEST THEN CLOSE

**Test first:**
1. Play several rounds
2. Clear multiple lines (rows, columns, squares)
3. Watch for UI getting stuck
4. Check for persistent red highlights
5. Check console for `pendingClears` errors

## If NOT Reproducible, Use This Comment:

Closing this PR as the stuck UI issue does not appear to be reproducible in the current main branch.

**What happened:**
This PR was created during a period when our deployment was broken, causing many apparent bugs that were actually just stale builds or deployment issues.

**What we did:**
- Fixed deployment model completely (`/src` ‚Üí `/docs`)
- Tested line clearing and UI state management thoroughly
- No stuck UI states observed in current version

**Testing:**
‚úÖ Line clears process correctly
‚úÖ No red highlight persistence
‚úÖ `pendingClears` state managed properly
‚úÖ UI responds correctly to all game events

If you can reproduce this issue in the latest version, please:
1. Open a new issue
2. Include steps to reproduce
3. Note browser/device
4. Include console errors

The timeout mechanism in this PR is a good safety net, but appears unnecessary with the current codebase. If issues arise, we can revisit this approach.

Thank you for the comprehensive debugging work! üôè

## If Still Reproducible:

Extract the timeout mechanism from `src/js/app.js`, then use:

Thank you for this comprehensive fix! We've extracted the timeout mechanism and incorporated it into main as part of our deployment migration.

**What we extracted:**
- Timestamp-based timeout for `pendingClears` state
- Manual reset enhancements
- Robust error handling for stuck states

**What we fixed overall:**
- Deployment model: `/src` ‚Üí `/docs`
- UI state management improvements
- Comprehensive testing of game mechanics

The timeout safety net you implemented is now part of the main branch.
