# PR #92: Investigate hidden game setting implementation - CLOSE IMMEDIATELY

**This was exactly the problem we just fixed!**

Closing this PR - you identified exactly the core problem we just fixed! üéØ

**The Issue:**
Settings weren't visible because our deployment was broken. Built files in root were stale, source files in `/src` had the updates but weren't being deployed.

**The Root Cause:**
- `vite.config.js` built to root (`outDir: '../'`)
- Build process was inconsistent  
- Source and built files mixed together
- Developers (and AI) edited wrong files
- Deployments were stale

**The Fix (Jan 3, 2025):**
Complete deployment model overhaul:
- ‚úÖ `/src` ‚Üí `/docs` build process
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of source and built files
- ‚úÖ Multiple layers of protection
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Read-only built files
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated warnings

**Result:**
All settings now visible because builds are fresh and deployment works correctly!

**Documentation:**
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete workflow
- `DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - What we fixed  
- `PWA_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Lessons from this experience

Thank you for identifying this symptom - it led us to fix the underlying deployment problem! üôè
