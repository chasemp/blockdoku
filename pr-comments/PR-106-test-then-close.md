## If Working, Use This Comment:

Closing this PR as it was created during a period when our deployment model was broken.

**What happened:**
We had source files in `/src` and built files mixed in root, causing deployment confusion. Many "bugs" were actually just stale builds.

**What we fixed:**
- Migrated to clear `/src` ‚Üí `/docs` workflow (Jan 3, 2025)
- Fixed navigation in source files
- Multiple layers of protection against editing wrong files
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Testing:**
The About section navigation now works correctly in the latest build from source.

**If the issue persists:**
Please reopen with steps to reproduce using the latest source from main branch.

Thank you for identifying this issue! üôè
