# PR #48 Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved merge conflicts between the sound customization feature branch and main branch.

## Conflict Details

### Conflicted Files
1. `build-info.json` - Build timestamp difference
2. `src/build-info.json` - Build timestamp difference
3. `index.html` - Asset hash differences from separate builds
4. `settings.html` - Asset hash differences from separate builds
5. `sw.js` - Service worker precache manifest differences

### Root Cause
Both branches had been built independently, generating different asset hashes and build timestamps. The main branch included PR #47 (visual score breakdown) while the feature branch included sound customization.

## Resolution Strategy

### Approach Used
1. **Merged with 'ours' strategy** to preserve sound customization changes
2. **Rebuilt the project** to regenerate correct asset hashes for combined codebase
3. **Committed the merge** with both features intact

### Commands Executed
```bash
git merge origin/main -X ours --no-commit
npm run build
git add -A
git commit -m "Merge branch 'main' into cursor/allow-custom-system-sounds-for-android-2c25"
git push origin cursor/allow-custom-system-sounds-for-android-2c25
```
