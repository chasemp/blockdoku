4. **Challenge Mode**: Custom level creation and sharing system
5. **Adaptive Difficulty**: AI-based difficulty adjustment for offline PWA
6. **Enhanced Game History**: Store complete game data for all high scores, not just the last game

### **Technical Considerations**:
- All features must work offline (PWA requirement)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing save data
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- Privacy-compliant data handling
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance

### **Future Considerations**:
- Potential for online features (if PWA requirements change)
- Community features and social integration
- Advanced AI/ML capabilities
