## üöÄ Implementation Priority

**Phase 1** should be implemented first as it provides immediate UX improvements that benefit all users.

**Phase 2** builds the foundation for more complex features and introduces the most requested gameplay enhancements.

**Phase 3** adds the exciting special mechanics that will differentiate the game.

**Phase 4** focuses on community and sharing features.
