## üî• **CRITICAL BUG - Theme Changes Reset Difficulty**

### **Issue Description:**
- User sets difficulty to **Easy** (UI shows "EASY")
- User goes to Settings and changes theme (any theme change)
- When returning to main game, difficulty has been reset to **Normal**
- This breaks the hint system which only works in Easy mode

### **Root Cause Investigation:**
The bug appears to be in the SettingsManager save/load cycle:

1. **Suspected Issue:** `SettingsManager.currentDifficulty` is not being updated when difficulty changes from main game
2. **When theme changes:** `selectTheme()` calls `saveSettings()` which overwrites storage with incorrect difficulty
3. **Result:** Easy difficulty gets overwritten with Normal

### **Debugging Added:**
```javascript
// In settings.js - added logging to:
- SettingsManager constructor (initial settings)
- loadSettings() (what gets loaded)  
- saveSettings() (what gets saved when theme changes)

// In app.js - added logging to:
- Window focus events (when returning from settings)
- loadSettings() (what main game loads from storage)
```

### **Test Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Set difficulty to Easy (confirm "EASY" shows in UI)
2. Go to Settings page
3. Change theme (wood ‚Üí light, etc.)
4. Check console for debug messages
5. Return to main game
6. Observe difficulty has reset to Normal

### **Expected Debug Output:**
Should show where `currentDifficulty` gets out of sync between main game and SettingsManager.

### **Potential Fixes:**
- Ensure SettingsManager reloads current difficulty when initialized
- Fix communication between main game difficulty changes and SettingsManager
- Prevent theme changes from affecting difficulty settings
