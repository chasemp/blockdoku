# Last Game Page Implementation

## Summary
Replaced the game over modal with a dedicated `lastgame.html` page to fix mobile viewport issues where the modal was too large to display properly on mobile screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `/src/lastgame.html`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page to display the last game statistics
- **Features**:
  - Fully responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
  - Displays all game stats: score, level, lines cleared, combos, etc.
  - Shows prize information (if prize recognition is enabled)
  - Shows next prize progress bar
  - Displays detailed score breakdown (lines, squares, placements, combos, streaks)
  - Shows petrification stats (if enabled)
  - Navigation buttons: New Game, Share, Settings, Back
  - Persistent - can be accessed anytime, not just after game over
  - Matches app theme styling (wood, light, dark)

### 2. Updated `/src/js/app.js`
- **`showGameOverModal()` function** (lines 2974-3017):
  - Changed from creating a modal to saving stats to localStorage
  - Navigates to `lastgame.html` instead of showing modal
  - Saves comprehensive game data including:
    - Score, level, lines cleared, combos
    - Prize information
    - Score breakdown
    - Petrification stats
    - Timestamp

- **`initializeGame()` function** (lines 3648-3680):
  - Added check for "New Game" flag from lastgame.html
  - Automatically starts a new game when returning from lastgame page via "New Game" button

### 3. Updated `/src/settings.html`
- **High Scores Section** (lines 759-772):
  - Added "View Last Game" button/link
  - Positioned prominently in the high scores section
  - Uses consistent nav-item styling

### 4. Updated `/workspace/vite.config.js`
- **Build Configuration** (lines 42-49):
  - Added `lastgame.html` to rollupOptions input
  - Ensures the page is included in production builds

## Navigation Flow

### Game Over Scenario:
1. Game ends → stats saved to `localStorage` as `blockdoku_lastgame`
2. Browser navigates to `lastgame.html`
3. Page loads and displays stats from localStorage
4. User can:
   - Click "New Game" → returns to `index.html` and starts fresh game
   - Click "Share" → shares score via Web Share API or clipboard
   - Click "Settings" → navigates to settings page
   - Click "Back" → returns to game board (previous state)

### Accessing Last Game Stats:
1. From Settings page → High Scores section → "View Last Game" button
2. Displays the most recent completed game stats
3. If no game completed yet, shows friendly "No Game Data" message

## Benefits

1. **Mobile-Friendly**: No more modal overflow issues on small screens
2. **Persistent Stats**: Last game stats remain accessible anytime
3. **Better UX**: Dedicated page allows for more detailed stats display
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Follows same pattern as settings page
5. **Theme Support**: Automatically uses current theme (wood/light/dark)
6. **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes

## Technical Details

### LocalStorage Keys:
- `blockdoku_lastgame`: Stores the last game statistics JSON
- `blockdoku_start_new_game`: Temporary flag to indicate new game should start

### Data Structure (blockdoku_lastgame):
```javascript
{
  score: number,
  level: number,
  linesCleared: number,
  maxCombo: number,
  totalCombos: number,
  maxStreakCount: number,

  isHighScore: boolean,
  breakdown: {
    linePoints: number,
    squarePoints: number,

```

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lastgame.html` - Created
2. `/src/js/app.js` - Modified showGameOverModal() and initializeGame()
3. `/src/settings.html` - Added link to lastgame.html
4. `/workspace/vite.config.js` - Added lastgame to build inputs
