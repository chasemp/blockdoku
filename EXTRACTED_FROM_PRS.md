## PR #105: Fix empty available blocks on load ✅

**Issue:** Block palette empty on first load or when returning from settings

**Changes Applied:**
1. **In `loadGameState()`** (line ~2739):
   - When no saved state exists, now generates blocks after ensuring palette is rendered
   - Added setTimeout delay to ensure DOM is ready
   - Better console logging for debugging

2. **In focus/storage event listeners** (lines ~133, ~151):
   - Added setTimeout(10ms) delays when reloading game state
   - Ensures DOM is ready when returning from settings or detecting settings changes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/js/app.js`

## PR #94: Debug stuck game UI state ✅ (PARTIAL)

**Issue:** Game UI gets stuck with pending line clears causing persistent red highlights

**Changes Applied:**
1. **In `checkLineClears()`** (line ~1298):
   - Added timeout check for `pendingClears` stuck > 5 seconds
   - Auto-resets if stuck too long
   - Moved timeout check BEFORE the pending check so it can actually reset

**Still Need to Apply:**
- Set `this.pendingClearsTimestamp = Date.now()` when pendingClears is set
- Clear timestamp when pendingClears is cleared
- Add `resetStuckUIState()` method (optional - manual reset)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/js/app.js` (partial)

**Next Steps:**
Search for all places where `this.pendingClears =` is set/cleared and ensure timestamps are managed.
